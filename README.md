and more attributes for different commodities collected from various mandis.

üìà Features & Visualizations
The project performs the following analyses:

Missing Value Analysis: Check for null/missing values in the dataset.

Correlation Heatmap: Visualize the correlation between numeric price fields using a heatmap.

Boxplot Visualization: Display the distribution of maximum prices for the top 15 districts.

Histogram with KDE: Analyze the distribution of Modal Prices with log-scaled axes.

Line Chart: Visualize Modal Prices of the first 20 entries for a quick trend view.

Pie Chart: Show the commodity proportion in the top district based on occurrences.

Barplot: Compare the average Modal Price of commodities across the top 5 districts.

Scatterplot Comparison: Compare Min, Max, and Modal prices for the top 15 commodities in a scatter plot.
